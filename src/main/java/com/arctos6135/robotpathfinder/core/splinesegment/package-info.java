/**
 * This package contains all the different types of spline segments of RobotPathfinder.
 * <p>
 * A spline is a function defined piecewise by polynomials. Splines are what's used to fit the {@link com.arctos6135.robotpathfinder.core.Waypoint Waypoint}s 
 * and construct paths. They're made of many spline segments, and each segment is defined by a parametric curve.
