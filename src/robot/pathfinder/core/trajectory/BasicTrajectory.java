/**
 * A class that represents a basic trajectory (motion profile). A trajectory not only defines the points that a 
 * robot will path through, it also provides information about the velocity, acceleration and direction. Most 
 * importantly, for any given time, it can provide information about the robot's whereabouts and other information. 
 * Note that unlike paths and spline segments, there is no common ancestor for all the trajectory types, because 
 * different types of trajectories are suited to different types of robots, and thus have very different interfaces.
 * <p>
 * Trajectories generated by this class assume a hypothetical robot that has limited speed and acceleration,
 * but unlimited jerk, and can move in any direction without slowing down (unless specified to be a tank drive
 * trajectory). In reality, because most drivetrains have to slow down when turning, the basic trajectory cannot 
 * be used. However, the generation of more advanced trajectories rely on a base provided by this class.

				 * the radius of the path.
				 * 
				 * 1. Rearrange equation 1: wb = r - l, l = r - wb
				 * 2. Since we want the robot to go as fast as possible, the faster wheel has velocity equal
				 * to the max velocity, denoted Vmax
				 * 3. If the right wheel is faster: r = Vmax, and by 1, l = Vmax - wb
				 * 4. Equation 2 becomes: (2Vmax - wb) / 2 = V
				 * 5. Substitute in equation 3, (2Vmax - (V / R)b) / 2 = V
				 * 6. Now solve for V: 2Vmax - (V / R)b = 2V, 2V + (V / R)b = 2Vmax, V(2 + b / R) = 2Vmax,
				 * V = 2Vmax / (2 + b / R), V = Vmax / (1 + b / (2R))
				 * 
				 * Repeat steps 3-6 for when the left wheel is faster, and the result will be V = Vmax / (1 - b / (2R));
				 * but since if the robot is turning right, the curvature and thus R are negative, the minus sign is
				 * cancelled out. The generalized equation then becomes V = Vmax / (1 + b / (2|R|)).
